# 🎯 Step-by-Step Setup Instructions for 3D Contribution Calendar

## 📝 FOR SREESHAN:

### Step 1: Create Your Profile Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. In "Repository name" type: **Sreeshan7** (exact same as your username)
3. Check "✅ Public"
4. Check "✅ Add a README file"
5. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Add the Workflow File
1. In your new repository, click "Add file" → "Create new file"
2. In the filename box, type: `.github/workflows/profile-3d.yml`
   - (Yes, include the dots and slashes - GitHub will create folders automatically)
3. Copy ALL the content from `sreeshan-workflow.yml` file (in the readme folder)
4. Paste it into the file editor
5. Scroll down and click "Commit changes"
6. Click "Commit changes" again in the popup

### Step 3: Run the Workflow (DETAILED EXPLANATION)

**Part A - Go to Actions:**
1. At the very top of your repository, you see tabs: "Code", "Issues", "Pull requests", "Actions"
2. Click the **"Actions"** tab

**Part B - Enable Workflows (if needed):**
- **IF** you see a message "Workflows aren't being run on this repository" with a big green button:
  - Click the green button that says **"I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"**
- **IF** you don't see that message:
  - That's okay! Actions are already enabled, just continue below

**Part C - Run the Workflow:**
1. Look at the **LEFT side** - you'll see "All workflows" with a list
2. Click **"Generate 3D Contribution Calendar"**
3. Now look at the **RIGHT side** of the screen
4. You'll see a gray button: **"Run workflow"** ← Click this!
5. A small box/dropdown appears below it
6. Inside that box, click the green **"Run workflow"** button
7. Wait 30-60 seconds
8. Press **F5** on your keyboard to refresh
9. You should see:
   - Orange circle 🟠 = running
   - Green checkmark ✅ = done!

**Visual Guide:**
```
LEFT SIDE:              RIGHT SIDE:
All workflows           [Run workflow ▼] ← Click here!
└─ Generate 3D...       Then click green button in dropdown
```

**Troubleshooting:**
- Don't see "Run workflow"? → Make sure you clicked the workflow name on the left first
- Still stuck? → Refresh the page (F5) and try again
- Wrong repository? → Check the URL - should be github.com/Sreeshan7/Sreeshan7

### Step 4: Fix the Workflow Error (IMPORTANT!)

**You'll see a RED X - that's normal! Here's how to fix it:**

1. At the top, you see "Workflow run was successfully requested" ✅ - Good!
2. Below, you see a **RED circle with X** next to your workflow - This needs fixing!

**How to fix:**

**Option A - Update the workflow file (EASIEST):**
1. Go back to your repository main page (click "Code" tab)
2. Click on the `.github` folder
3. Click on `workflows` folder
4. Click on `profile-3d.yml` file
5. Click the pencil icon ✏️ (top right) to edit
6. **Delete everything** in the file
7. Copy the UPDATED content from `sreeshan-workflow.yml` again (I just fixed it!)
8. Paste it in
9. Click "Commit changes"
10. Go back to Actions tab → Click "Run workflow" again
11. Wait 1-2 minutes → Refresh → Should now have GREEN checkmark ✅

**Option B - Enable workflow permissions:**
1. Click "Settings" tab (at the very top)
2. On the left menu, scroll down to "Actions" → Click "General"
3. Scroll to bottom: "Workflow permissions"
4. Select **"Read and write permissions"**
5. Click "Save"
6. Go back to Actions → Run the workflow again

### Step 5: Your 3D Calendar is Ready!
The workflow created a folder called `profile-3d-contrib` with your 3D calendar SVG files.
They're already linked in the main README - just upload it to the Stackxs organization!

## ⚠️ Important Notes:

- The 3D calendars will update automatically every day
- If they don't show immediately, wait 24 hours or run the workflow again
- Make sure BOTH Sreeshan and Himanshu complete their steps
- The organization README will work once both profile calendars are generated

## 🆘 If Something Doesn't Work:

1. Make sure repository names match usernames EXACTLY
2. Make sure all repositories are PUBLIC
3. Try running the workflow manually again (Actions → Run workflow)
4. Wait a few minutes and refresh the page

That's it! Everything will work perfectly if you follow these steps. 🚀
